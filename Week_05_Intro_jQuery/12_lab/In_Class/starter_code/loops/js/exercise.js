/**
 * Question 1
 * Create an array of numbers using 1,2,3, and 4 as values.

 * The end result should be an array of numbers with values 2,3,4,5
 */


/**

* Create an array of names with Will, Nevan, and Jessica as values.

* Hint: $(.class).append(); will append things to the class called .class
*/

/**
